# Ticket System

This is a test exam to be done as part of the recruitment processes at Net Tech International.

The test has a time to completion of **7 days** after the initial email is sent by one of our members.

**IMPORTANT: THE COMPLETION OF THIS TEST DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT A CANDIDATE WILL GET HIRED**

### Test

The test consists of a basic **Ticket System** which includes the following modules:

1. Ticket Module (w/ CRUD)
2. Employee Module (w/ Login, and CRUD)
3. Report Module

The basic idea behind the application is that an Employee can log in and create/update/delete tickets and also create time entries for each of the tickets. Later, a report can be generated to get the hours worked by an employee during a time frame.

#### Sample Screens

Note: These screens are meant to be for illustration purposes only and should not be used as a definitive layout. You are open to show the information in the way that is best for you as long as it provides the functionality that is requested.

**IMPORTANT**
- **NOTE THAT IF YOU LEAVE OUT CRUCIAL DETAILS ON HOW TO SETUP YOUR APPLICATION WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TEST IT.**
- **ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THIS APPLICATION WILL NOT RUN ON YOUR COMPUTER, IT WILL RUN ON SOMEONE ELSE'S. (i.e: Avoid hard coding things like  'localhost' or other type of urls!)**
- **AS A COMMON PRACTICE, TRY TO MAKE YOUR SETUP AS USER FRIENDLY AND AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. WE MAY ASSIGN SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A PROGRAMMER TO SETUP YOUR APPLICATION AS PART OF THE EVALUATION.**
- **DOCUMENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT.**
